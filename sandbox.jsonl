{"text": "Jefa raises $2 million to offer digital accounts for women in LATAM. Fintech startup Jefa has raised a $2 million seed round to build a fintech startup offering digital accounts with a product specifically designed for women living in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company has managed to attract 115,000 women on its waitlist and participated in TechCrunch\u2019s Startup Battlefield last year.Investors in Jefa include The Venture Collective, DST Global, Foundation Capital, Amador Holdings, The Fund, FINCA Ventures, Rarebreed VC, Siesta Ventures, Springbank Collective, Bridge Partners, Hustle Fund, Foundation Capital, Latitud, J20 and Magma Partners. Several business angels also participated, such as Daniel Bilbao, JP Duque, Ricardo Schaefer, Jean-Paul Orillac and Allan Arguello.In addition to this founding round, the startup has also signed a deal with Visa. It\u2019s a multi-year strategic partnership agreement. Jefa will be able to take advantage of Visa\u2019s resources and products to create its payment products and more.\u201cVisa believes in empowering women,\u201d senior director of fintech partnerships for Visa Latin America and the Caribbean Sonia Michaca said in a statement. \u201cFinancial and digital inclusion transform economies. Women, who control the lion-share of everyday household spending, should be at the core of this transformation, yet women are vastly underserved by traditional banks. We are thrilled to be partnering with Jefa, a women-led platform in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one which explicitly serves women\u2019s financial needs in the region.\u201d  The team behind Jefa believes that banks have neglected women for too long. Even challenger banks have mostly been designed for male customers in the first place. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that women can\u2019t open an account with a challenger bank. But some product decisions are unfriendly to women.Back when Jefa founder and CEO Emma Smith pitched at TechCrunch Disrupt, she listed some of the reasons why most people in Latin America who don\u2019t currently have a bank account are women. For instance, minimum balance requirements are hostile to women who statistically earn less than men.When Jefa launches, the company will let you open a digital account for free from a mobile app. You don\u2019t have to visit a bank branch. A few days later, you\u2019ll receive a Visa debit card. There will be a built-in savings feature and a reward program.The startup plans to roll out its product in Mexico first, then Colombia and Central America. Jefa isn\u2019t the first fintech startup trying to branch out from the unified banking offering. There are several startups trying to create vertical banks, such as banks for kids (Greenlight or Step) or banks for climate change-focused customers (Aspiration). And there\u2019s now Jefa offering digital accounts for women.Image Credits: JefaJefa is a challenger bank for women without a bank account"}
{"text": "Flowrite is an AI writing productivity tool that wants to help you hit inbox zero. When TechCrunch asks Flowrite if it\u2019s \u2018Grammarly on steroids\u2019, CEO and co-founder Aaro Isosaari laughs, saying that\u2019s the comment they always get for the AI writing productivity tool they\u2019ve been building since late summer 2020 \u2014 drawing on early access to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 API, and attracting a wait-list of some 30,000 email-efficiency seeking prosumers keen to get their typing fingers on its beta.The quest for \u2018Inbox zero\u2019 \u2014 via lightning speed email composition \u2014 could be rather easier with this AI-powered sidekick. At least if you\u2019re the sort of person who fires off a bunch of fairly formulaic emails each and every day.What does Flowrite do exactly? It turns a few instructions (yes you do have to type these) into a fully fledged, nice to read email. So where Grammarly helps improve a piece of (existing) writing, by suggesting tweaks to grammar/syntax/style etc., Flowrite helps you write the thing in the first place, so long as the thing is email or some other professional messaging type comms.Email is what Flowrite\u2019s AI models have been trained on, per Isosaari. And frustration with how much time he was having to spend composing emails was the inspiration for the startup. So its focus is firmly professional comms \u2014 rather than broader use cases for AI-generated words, such as copy writing etc (which GPT-3 is also being used for).Grammarly raises $200M at a $13B valuation to make you an even better writer using AI\u201cIn my previous work I knew that this is a problem that I had \u2014 I\u2019d spend several hours every day communicating with different stakeholders on email and other messaging platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also knew that there are a lot more people \u2014 it\u2019s not just our problem as co-founders; there\u2019s millions of people who could benefit from communicating more effectively and efficiently in their day to day work.\u201dHere\u2019s how Flowrite works: The user provides a set of basic (bullet pointed) instructions covering the key points of what they want to say and the AI-powered tool does the rest \u2014 generating a full email text that conveys the required info in a way that, well, flows.Automation is thus doing the wordy leg work of filling in courteous greetings/sign-offs and figuring out appropriate phrasing to convey the sought for tone and impression.Compared to email templates (an existing tech for email productivity), Isosaari says the advantage is the AI-powered tool adapts to context and \u201cisn\u2019t static\u201d.One obvious but important point is that the user does also of course get the chance to check over \u2014 and edit/tweak \u2014 the AI\u2019s suggested text before hitting send so the human remains firmly the agent in the loop.Isosaari gives an example use-case of a sales email where the instructions might boil down to typing something like \u201csounds amazing \u2022 let\u2019s talk more in a call \u2022 next week, Monday PM\u201d \u2014 in order to get a Flowrite-generated email that includes the essential details plus \u201call the greetings\u201d and \u201cadded formalities\u201d the extended email format requires.(Sidenote: Flowrite\u2019s initial pitch to TechCrunch was via email \u2014 but did not apparently involve the use of its tool. At least the email did not include a disclosure that: \u201cThis email is\u00a0Flowritten\u201d as a later missive from Isosaari (to send the PR as requested) did. Which, perhaps, gives an indication of the sorts of email comms you might want to speed-write (with AI) and those you maybe want to dedicated more of your human brain to composing (or at least look like you wrote it all yourself).)\u201cWe\u2019ve built an AI powered writing tools that helps professionals of all kinds to write and communicate faster as part of their daily workflow,\u201d Isosaari tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s millions of people who spend hours every day on emails and messages in a professional context \u2014 so communicating with different stakeholders, internally and externally, takes a lot of work, daily working hours. And Flowrite helps people to do that faster.\u201dThe AI tool could also be a great help to people who find writing difficult for specific reasons such as dyslexia or because English is not their native language, he further suggests.One obvious limitation is that Flowrite is only able to turn out emails in English. And while GPT-3 does have models for some other common languages, Isosaari suggests the quality of its \u2018human-like\u2019 responses there \u201cmight not be as good\u201d as they are in English \u2014 hence he says they\u2019ll remain focused there for now.They\u2019re using GPT-3\u2019s language model as the core AI tech \u2014 but have also, recently, begun to use their own accumulated data to \u201cfine tune it\u201d, with Isosaari noting: \u201cAlready we\u2019ve built a lot of things on top of GPT-3 as opposed to building a wrapper on it.\u201dThe startup\u2019s promise for the email productivity tool is also that the AI will adapt to the user\u2019s writing style \u2014 so that faster emails won\u2019t also mean curtly out of character emails (which could lead to fresh emails asking if you\u2019re okay?).Isosaari says the tech is not not mining your entire email history to do this \u2014 but rather only looks at the directly preceding context in an email thread (if there is one).Flowrite does also currently rely on cloud processing, since it\u2019s calling GPT-3\u2019s tech, but he says they want to move to on-device processing, which would obviously help address any confidentiality concerns, when we ask about that.For now the tool is browser-based and integrates with web email. Currently it only works for Chrome and Gmail but Isosaari confirms the team\u2019s plan is to expand integrations \u2014 such as for messaging platforms like Slack (but still initially at least, only for the web app version).While the tech tool is still in a closed beta, the startup has just announced a $4.4 million seed raise.The seed is led by Project A, along with Moonfire Ventures and angel investors Ilkka Paananen (CEO & Co-founder of Supercell), Sven Ahrens (director of global growth at Spotify), and Johannes Schildt (CEO & Co-Founder of Kry). Existing investors Lifeline Ventures and Seedcamp also joined in the round.What types of emails and professionals is Flowrite best suited for? On the content side, Isosaari says it\u2019s \u201ctypically replies where there\u2019s some kind of existing context that you are responding to\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s able to understand the situation really well and adapt to it in a really natural way,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAnd also for outreaches \u2014 things like pitches and proposals\u2026 What it doesn\u2019t work that well for is if you want to write something that is really, really complex \u2014 because then in order to do that you would need to have all that information in the instructions. And then obviously if you need to spend a lot of time writing the instruction that could be even close to the final email \u2014 and there\u2019s not much value that Flowrite can provide at that point.\u201dIt\u2019s also obviously not going to offer great utility if you\u2019re firing off \u201creally, really short emails\u201d \u2014 since if you\u2019re just answering with a couple of words it\u2019s likely quicker to type that yourself.In terms of who\u2019s likely to use Flowrite, Isosaari says they\u2019ve had a broad range of early adopters seeking to tap into the beta. But he describes the main user profile as \u201cexecutives, managers, entrepreneurs who communicate a lot on a daily basis\u201d \u2014 aka, people who \u201cneed to give a good impression about themselves and communicate very thoughtfully\u201d.On the business model front, Flowrite\u2019s initial focus is on prosumers/individual users \u2014 although Isosaari says it may look to expand out from there, perhaps first supporting teams. And he also says he could envisage some kind of SaaS offering for businesses down the line.Currently, it\u2019s not charging for the beta \u2014 but does plan to add pricing early next year. \u201cOnce we move out of the beta then we\u2019ll be starting to monetize,\u201d he adds, suggesting that a full launch out of beta (so no more waitlist) could happen by mid 2022.\u00a0The seed funding will primarily be spent on growing the team, according to Isosaari, especially on the engineering side \u2014 with the main goal at this early stage being to tool up around AI and core product.Expanding features is another priority \u2014 including adding a \u201chorizontal way\u201d of using the tool across the browser, such as with different email clients.This report was updated to clarify a quotation by Isosaari as he intended to say Flowrite is not just building a wrapper for GPT-3 but rather that it\u2019s building on top of itOkay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable"}
