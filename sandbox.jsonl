Palmisano, Chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise and former Chairman and CEO of IBM; and Steel Perlot, with existing participation from BootstrapLabs, Breyer Capital, Good Growth Capital, Greycroft and Revolution\u2019s Rise of the Rest.Incoming board members include Kirsten Wolberg, former executive with DocuSign, PayPal and Salesforce; Michelle Ritter, CEO of Steel Perlot, a management company incubating, investing in, and scaling companies in today\u2019s most challenging technical industries; and Pryon\u2019s Chris Mahl.\u201cThis is an incredible time for Pryon\u2019s platform,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cSteel Perlot believes applied AI will increasingly transform business at scale. Pryon is applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle a massive problem in workplace productivity and knowledge management. We invested in Pryon\u2019s mission and team because we believe it has the technical depth, leadership, access, and product to become a category-defining company.\u201dPalmisano said, \u201cAs businesses are accelerating their digital transformation, Pryon's AI technology addresses the critical need for organizations to translate massive volumes of legacy content into actionable knowledge.\u201dWolberg added, \u201cPryon has developed technology that fills a gap in the enterprise software stack. In my experience, what the company offers is critical for organizations who deal with large amounts of application or document-based data, or those who want to expand the capabilities of their virtual assistants. The sky is really the limit for how Pryon\u2019s platform can be applied to provide a unique level of accuracy and speed to the management of enterprise knowledge. I look forward to being a part of their journey.\u201dPryon applies AI-based intelligent document processing (IDP) to augment unstructured data from disparate sources such as application knowledge bases, digital libraries and document stores. Using proprietary computer vision and natural language engines, the company\u2019s platform enriches the content to boost accuracy. This information retrieval for question answering (IRQA) capability allows users and systems to dynamically converse with previously static information. The platform\u2019s API also rapidly expands the functionality of existing AI assistants, chatbots, and interactive voice response (IVR) installations, which can typically only respond to a limited set of requests, reducing the business impact of contact centers and help desks.Mahl said, \u201cSince the moment I met the team, I have been incredibly impressed and sense the same level of energy, quality and vision I witnessed in my time at Salesforce and other successful companies in hyper growth. Our sole purpose at Pryon is to transform enterprise content into a cohesive asset that drives business value.\u201dAbout PryonPryon is an artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on enterprise knowledge management.
