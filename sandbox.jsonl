TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Mindspace, the global flex office provider, secured a funding of $72 million. The investment round is intended to support the continuation of the company's growth and its further expansion in Europe, the United States and Israel. The round was led by Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services Ltd., More Provident Funds, Shalom Meckenzie, Arkin Holdings and existing investors. Existing investors include: Yoav Harlap, Kobi Rogovin and Globalworth. Continue ReadingMindspace founders Dan Zakai (left) and Yotam Alroy (right). Image copyright: David Garb (PRNewsfoto/Mindspace)Mindspace, founded in 2014 by Dan Zakai and Yotam Alroy, currently operates 32 branches in 17 cities in seven countries, spread over 100,000 square meters (over 1 million sq. ft). In the past year alone, Mindspace successfully launched new branches in London, Tel Aviv, Philadelphia\u00a0and a new hub and spoke location outside Tel Aviv, at Yakum. Mindspace serves a wide variety of companies; about 41% are large enterprises and corporations and 38% are small and medium-sized companies. The leading industry types of its customer base are technology companies, financial companies and service providers. Past and present customers include Microsoft, Samsung, Playtika, Taboola, Yahoo!, Expedia, GoPro, and more.While most of the commercial real estate industry took a hit as a result of COVID, the flex market continued to grow. All forecasts predict the accelerated growth of the flex industry to reach a market share of more than 30% by 2030; the current market share of flex as part of commercial real estate is 5%. According to a recent study by CBRE, in two years 43% of occupiers will have 10-50% of their portfolio dedicated to flex. In addition, 17% of occupiers will have more than 50% of their portfolio dedicated to flex.\"Mindspace is experiencing an impressive growth momentum and high demand in all its locations\", says Dan Zakai, CEO and Co-founder of Mindspace. \"We successfully faced the many challenges of COVID. Today, our locations are almost at full occupancy and the current investment led by Harel Insurance and More Provident Funds is intended to fulfill the rising demand in the market and to launch new locations in partnership with landlords worldwide\", says Zakai. In addition, he comments that \"Mindspace isn't just another real estate company that rents out offices, but rather offers a strong, strategic partnership to its customers and to landlords. When choosing their office environment, we found that our customers put a great emphasis on their experience: central location, unique design and service of the highest standard. We expect a continued accelerated growth in 2022, while creating a great added value for our many customers,\" adds Zakai.Mindspace provides well designed offices, luxurious lounges, fully equipped kitchens and meeting rooms, in addition to its unique community of leading entrepreneurs, business professionals and established companies. Mindspace allows for greater flexibility, shorter term commitments and lower financial risk, which is the most suitable solution in times of economic slowdown. These benefits explain the global increase in demand for flex and the many supportive forecasts of industry analysts.In 2021, Mindspace demonstrated a significant recovery when it reached the pre-COVID occupancy levels of early 2020, and even exceeded them with over 95% occupancy in Israel and Germany. The high occupancy levels are not the result of lowered prices as Mindspace maintained its pre-pandemic prices.In the past two years, Mindspace signed six management agreements with landlords in Europe, Israel and the U.S., including for its recent launches in Israel and Philadelphia. A management agreement is a model that is gaining both momentum and recognition worldwide, inspired by the hotel industry. This innovative concept presents a partnership between the landlord and the flex operator, allowing increased profitability and greater flexibility for the landlord, while providing a relevant response to today's market landscape.Earlier in March 2021, Mindspace launched \"Hybrid\", a new array of on-demand office solutions for companies and individuals who work under a hybrid model, combining work from home and in-office. The shift to hybrid has been on the rise for a few years and the outbreak of the pandemic has accelerated the process. At Mindspace, the increase of the hybrid trend is noticeable: casual, on-demand contracts have almost tripled in the past six months, compared to the same period last year, pre-COVID. As part of Mindspace's innovative development and the current flex trend, tenant experience is taking up a more central position. This experience envelops the customer journey from the first encounter with the office space through the use of the space and its various services, all the way to the end of the work day in the office. Tenant experience is accompanied by technological innovations, such as apps, data-driven insights and personalized activities, that enable the expansion of services and benefits to additional tenants in the buildings.Sami Babkov, Deputy CEO and CIO at Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services, Ltd.: \"Harel is proud to lead the current investment round with a total funding of $30 million. This investment is an expression of confidence in the flexible workspace model, against the backdrop of COVID's impact on the office market, and shows confidence in Mindspace's experienced and professional management team. Through this investment we're able to diversify and improve our investments in real estate and faithfully serve the customers utilizing Harel's investment department.\u00a0\u00a0\"We believe Mindspace brings an interesting model to the market - both economically and in terms of the value it produces for its customers,\" says Ori Keren, CIO at More Provident Funds. \"In a short time the company managed to create new standards in the market, to build high loyalty among its customers and is experiencing steady growth.\"\u00a0Barak Capital Underwriting, Ltd. served as the investment banker in the transaction.About MindspaceMindspace is a boutique flex space provider, presenting a global mindset with a local flavor. We redefine the workplace experience for companies of all sizes. Our beautifully designed spaces, personalized level of service and carefully curated events foster enhanced employee engagement and a strong sense of community, accommodating the way people work, innovate and grow. Our customer base includes blue-chip companies, enterprises and SMBs, in 32 locations, 17 cities and seven countries across Europe and the US. Mindspace is home to corporations and large companies such as Microsoft, Samsung, Playtika, Yahoo!, Expedia, GoPro, Taboola, Techstars Accelerator, Barclays Bank, Klarna and more.Amongst its landlord partners are JTLV2, Patrizia, an affiliate of Rubenstein Partners Ltd., REIT1 and Rogovin-Tidhar.\u00a0For further information please visit Mindspace.me,\u00a0or follow Mindspace on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook\u00a0or Instagram.Contact: Nicole Nanikashvili [email\u00a0protected]SOURCE Mindspace"}

{"text": "TabTrader raises $5.8M for a mobile app that aggregates crypto exchange data. As many of the top cryptocurrencies seem to temporarily stabilize near all-time highs, users looking to speculate on tokens that are a bit more volatile are searching across exchanges to find deals.Amsterdam-based startup TabTrader has been capitalizing on this search with a platform that aggregates prices and token availability across dozens of exchanges. While other platforms allow users to look at token prices across exchanges, most are desktop-optimized while TabTrader has built up a substantial presence for its mobile app on iOS and Android.As different exchanges take different approaches toward onboarding new tokens, crypto traders are increasingly signing up for accounts on multiple exchanges and tracking prices across multiple apps with multiple notification types set for each. Many users rely on TabTrader for its cross-exchange price alert feature, notifying users when a particular token has gone above or below a certain value. While plenty of exchanges offer this functionality inside their native apps, the reliability and customizability of these push notifications has often been inconsistent.CEO Kirill Suslov tells TechCrunch that the TabTrader app has more than 400,000 active users, with particularly strong presences in Europe and Asia.The startup has adopted a Kayak-like model, aggregating prices for tokens and picking up rebate fees from exchanges when users make a purchase through the app. While users plug their wallet info into the app to easily make purchases through connected exchanges, Suslov says that TabTrader never has access to user funds.Alongside these rebates, TabTrader also makes money through a $12 monthly subscription for a paid version, as well as advertising. Suslov says his 20-person team has scaled to reach their current audience without any paid marketing.While tens of millions of users have created accounts on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, Suslov says that TabTrader\u2019s biggest opportunity may be embracing so-called decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which allow users to rapidly exchange tokens with other users.Suslov says that while the exchanges have built out great technology in the back-end, the front-end interfaces aren\u2019t as easy for users to navigate, leaving room for an aggregator like TabTrader to streamline the user experience while allowing users to explore decentralized exchanges for the first time. The startup says they\u2019re starting with a number of Solana-based exchanges including Serum, Raydium and Orca.\u201c[Decentralized exchanges] are the hottest topic of 2021,\u201d Suslov says. \u201cWe raised to get onto this rocket ship.\u201dSuslov tells TechCrunch that TabTrader has banked $5.8 million in Series A funding from 100X Ventures, Hashkey Capital, Spartan Capital, SGH Capital, SOSV and Artesian Venture Partners."}

The round, which is co-led by Tiger Global and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, values Spinny at over $1.75 billion post-money, the source said.This is the third funding round raised by Spinny this year. The startup was valued at about $700 million in July this year and $350 million in April.The new round follows quarters of strong growth that saw Spinny expand to 15 Indian cities, up from fewer than half a dozen last year. The startup has grown its business by four times in the current calendar year, the source said, requesting anonymity as the figures are not public.Spinny, which counts Elevation Capital and Accel among its existing backers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indian news outlet Entrackr first reported about the funding round.Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying them through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.Spinny is addressing this by removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. The startup buys cars from the owners, performs thorough and transparent inspections and then makes them available for customers to purchase.Niraj Singh, a former teacher, co-founded Spinny. (Image Credits: Spinny)If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get a full refund, the startup says on the website.The growth potential for Spinny and some other startups operating in this space is massive.\u00a0The market for auto e-commerce currently has less than 1% penetration in India, according to analysts at Bernstein.\u201cThis is largely because the auto market still requires physical inspections and the target market skews towards used vehicles \u2014 an unorganized market,\u201d they wrote in a report earlier this year.\u201cThe total addressable market in India is around $220 billion, which includes used vehicle purchase by consumers, auctions and remarketing, growth potential for the new vehicles market, and financing and advertisements. The total addressable market for only the used car market in US is over $800 billion,\u201d they wrote in a report earlier this year.Spinny is the second Indian startup to become a unicorn this week. India has produced more than three dozen unicorns this year \u2014 more than all other years put together \u2014 after several high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge Capital, began to double down on the world\u2019s second-largest internet market earlier this year at the height of the ravaging pandemic.In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Tiger Global identified India as one of the few markets where it was planning to deploy billions of dollars. SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said earlier this month that the Japanese firm has invested more than $3 billion in India this year and can invest up to $10 billion in the country next year."}
{"text": "Nigeria\u2019s OnePipe raises $3.5M to double down on its embedded finance offering. Last year, fintech API infrastructure players came into the African tech scene, ushering in Plaid-like services to businesses and developers.And the attention on these companies, particularly from venture capitalists, spiralled into this year, with each significant player raising large seed to Series A rounds. OnePipe, a fintech API company with a different play from the lot, joins the list today, raising $3.5 million seed to double down on its embedded finance offering.African impact-focused VC\u00a0Atlantica Ventures, a co-lead investor in OnePipe\u2019s $950,000 pre-seed round last year, also co-led this seed round alongside\u00a0Tribe Capital and V&R Associates.New investors Canaan Partners, Saison Capital, Norrsken (the fund of Klarna founder Niklas Adalberth), The Fund and Two Culture Cap also participated. Existing investors Chris Adelsbach, Techstars, Ingressive Capital, Acquity, P1, Raba and DFS Lab followed on with new checks, alongside a few angel investors.There are generally three main fintech API infrastructure plays. One is data and financial accounts aggregation (Plaid, Okra, Mono, Stitch and Pngme are some players in the space). The second focuses on embedded finance and banking as a service, where Treasury Prime, Marqeta ply their trade. The third is core open banking pioneered by the likes of TrueLayer.OnePipe\u2019s original game plan was to create an API gateway that connected banks and fintechs under a uniform standard, a move that would allow the company to perform core open banking.\u00a0But founder and CEO Ope Adeoye (self-described as the company\u2019s chief plumber), on a call with TechCrunch, said upon continuous integration with these financial institutions, it became clear the company needed to pivot since it wasn\u2019t generating many demand cycles. And having struck partnerships with a few banks, OnePipe decided to take a step back and delve into the world of embedded finance.Unlike open banking and data aggregation plays where a company needs to collaborate with almost every bank in the country where they operate, it\u2019s not necessarily the case with companies offering embedded finance. That\u2019s why OnePipe has six partner banks at the moment.\u201cThe caveat goes like this, the moment you make a positioning play for banking as a service, all you really need is one partner bank that lets you go deep because the embedded finance [offering] is about depth and not breadth,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cIf you go for data aggregation or open banking in general, then you are going for breadth, not depth. So on our side, we said we\u2019d rather go with tier two and tier three bands, where once you describe the concept to them, they get it. It powers their growth and is more valuable to them, unlike other larger financial institutions.\u201dBy running API infrastructure on behalf of these partner banks and helping them monetize it, OnePipe works with non-financial institutions to launch and cross-sell an array of financial services such as credit, accounts and payments within their offerings.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe raised a round last year to focus on one use case of the partnership, which was to pull together the APIs of a fixed set of banks and offer embedded banking or banking as a service play,\u201d Adeoye asserted. \u201cMeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201dSo an FMCG startup, for instance, can plug into a bank\u2019s API managed by OnePipe and begin to issue accounts to customers, allowing them to make payments off those accounts and access credit when they need it.With open banking on the horizon, the fintech-SME love story is just beginningIn the 10 months OnePipe switched up to this model, it has processed more than 6.3 million transactions worth over $46.3 million, the company said. These numbers are from over 1 million individual accounts and 138+ businesses, ranging from FMCG and retail to lending and agriculture.OnePipe takes a percentage cut from transactions made on these accounts and shares with its partner banks. For loans offered via its APIs, OnePipe takes at least 1% of the loan interest from its lending partners and also shares it with the businesses and partner banks.With what OnePipe has accomplished so far, Aniko Szigetvari, the founding partner at Atlantica Ventures, believes the company is not only deepening financial inclusion in Nigeria but the continent.\u00a0\u201cIn our view, embedded finance is the next enabler for both traditional and financial service businesses to increase customer loyalty and revenue by offering a wide range of third-party financial products and revenue streams for their customers,\u201d she said.Though OnePipe is currently only present in Nigeria, it is making its first move beyond the country\u2019s shores to align with Szigetvari\u2019s statement. OnePipe is going through a strategic partnership route as Adeoye mentioned that his company made a deal with African logistics and freight company Sendy to expand into other African countries. Per the company\u2019s statement, the plan is to \u201cpull a Stripe-Shopify-esque tag team.\u201d\u201cWe made sure that before we looked into other African countries, we were going in with a customer on the ground already,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cWe did a deal with Sendy that made them participate in this round, and we will then deploy the capital for expansion. So as they go to Egypt, South Africa, we\u2019ll be deploying with them and grow together.\u201dAfrican startups join global funding boom as fintech shines"}
{"text": "Kenyan fintech Asilimia raises $2 million in a pre-seed round, plans to extend loans to MSMEs and expand in East Africa. Kenya\u2019s economy is powered by informal businesses, which contribute 33.8% to the country\u2019s GDP and provide 83.4% of the total employment outside of small-scale agriculture, data from the country\u2019s bureau of statistics shows. The contribution of these enterprises is pivotal to the country\u2019s economy, yet they remain underserved by traditional banking institutions, making it hard for them to access the financing needed to grow.On the other hand, the financing gap left by conventional banking institutions has presented an opportunity for innovation, leading to the birth of fintechs like Asilimia. The Kenyan startup has over the last three years been offering a lifeline to traders in Kenya by enabling them to make mobile money transactions that are devoid of transfer charges (through its Leja app).And now, having secured $2 million in pre-seed funding ($1 million equity and $1 million debt), the startup is headed for its next phase of growth, which will involve extending loans to traders offering more relief to this subgroup that is often left out and regarded as high risk by the traditional banking sector.The funding came from various investors, including Fredrik Jung Abbou, a two-time unicorn founder and Norrsken Impact Accelerator, while the debt round had the participation of French Public Investment Bank (Bpifrance) and GreenTec Capital Partners.Asilimia is set to use the funding to hire talent as it looks to fine-tune its technology and expand to another market within East Africa. It will also extend loans to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) based on data from its Leja app.\u201cWe have entered a phase where we are exploring ways in which we can extend the much-needed credit enabling traders to buy equipment or products to sustain their enterprises,\u201d Asilimia co-founder and CEO Tekwane Mwendwa told TechCrunch.Morgane Kablan, is the startup\u2019s other co-founder and chief operating officer.By providing mobile loans, Asilimia will join a space that has about 100 lending apps, including Branch by San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd and PayPal-backed Tala.Asilimia team in Nairobi, Kenya. Image\u00a0Credits: Asilimia.The Digital Lenders Association of Kenya told TechCrunch in a past interview that about 25 apps it represents disburse about $40 million a month. The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers looking for quick cash.In addition to enabling users to make mobile money transactions at no fee, Leja also supports bookkeeping, making it easier for the traders to track their revenues and outflows, without the need for technical or accounting knowledge. The platform provides valuable data that Asilimia plans to tap to extend loans to users.Mwendwa said that Asilimia will create credit scoring models from the collected data to determine how much will be extended to borrowers.\u201cWe will factor in their B2B transactions, cash flow, sales, liabilities and expenses because all this information is in the app. This is possible because traders love to use our app which, unlike other lending apps, has inventory management. I like to think of our app as the operating system of informal businesses and we are happy that it is a one-stop shop for the traders,\u201d said Mwendwa.\u201cAnother thing that traders struggle with is airtime top-up. We interact with them daily and understand their pain points, and so we want to give them all the support they need so that they can continue doing business \u2014 we will also extend airtime top-up credit at no interest,\u201d he said.Mwendwa said that a normal user makes about three transactions through the app every day and the business has been growing 30% week on week. About 27,000 users use its apps, with total transactions done through the Leja app reaching about $20 million.Previously, the startup has been through the prestigious Station F incubation program in Paris and the Norrsken Impact Accelerator program. In 2019, the startup won the Africa Cup at the 2019 SA Innovation Summit, securing a $350,000 investment from Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment firm. It used the financing to fund its growth which included adding Leja to its portfolio.Beyond East Africa, Asilimia is exploring growth opportunities in other regions, as it seeks to continue bridging the financing gap currently experienced by traders across the continent.\u201cMSMEs play a vital role across Africa and making it easier for them to succeed is great for the continent as a whole,\u201d said Norrsken Impact Accelerator co-founder and managing director Funda Sezgi.\u201cTekwane and the team have built a solution that works and we are delighted to be supporting them as they drive prosperity in a key sector for the African economy.\u201d"}
{"text": "Vollebak, which makes \u2018clothes for the future,\u2019 is closing its Series A round. If you\u2019ve ever visited the site of the six-year-old, London-based direct-to-consumer clothing company Vollebak, you\u2019ve likely marveled at the exaggerated descriptions of clothing it sells, including a jacket \u201cdesigned for a world of megastorms, where \u2018waterproof\u2019 is not enough,\u201d a hoodie that promises to repel rain, wind, snow and fire; and and an \u201cice age\u201d fleece \u201cdesigned to recreate the feeling and performance of the soft hides worn by prehistoric man.\u201dThat marketing genius comes directly from CEO Steve Tidball, who co-founded the outfit with his twin, Nick Tidball \u2014 both of whom worked in advertising previously and both of whom are active outdoorsmen, though their families and the growth of Vollebak have kept them closer to home in recent years. Indeed, Steve Tidball writes the copy himself, he revealed last week in an interview about Vollebak, a brand that prides itself on making \u201cclothes for the future.\u201dDuring that chat, he also answered our questions about how much tech is actually involved in the clothing\u2019s production. And he let us know that Vollebak has so far raised around $10 million in outside funding, including through a Series A round that is about to close, led by the London-based venture firm Venrex, with participation from Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, and Headspace CFO Sean Brecker, among others. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.TC: You started this company with your twin, Nick. So much of its genius seems to be in how your clothing is marketed. Tell us a bit about how it came together.ST: We launched the company five years ago. Before that, we\u2019d been working together in advertising for 15 years, so I think one of the reasons the marketing is more fun than it might otherwise be is that was our job.We\u2019ve operated by an incredibly simple rule from a marketing perspective, which is basically: spend as little money as humanly possible. So, for instance, a couple years ago, we created our first piece of clothing for space, which was a deep sleep cocoon. And in marketing, you\u2019re always [asking] who\u2019s your audience, and really, our audience was one person here, which was Elon [Musk], so we found a billboard [space] opposite SpaceX, and we just took out a poster there, and it said, \u201cOur jackets are ready. How\u2019s your rocket going?\u201d It doesn\u2019t cost much money, but it was really great fun, and NASA called the next week, and then we got [to] chatting to them.Your clothing is a reflection of the stuff that you think is going to happen to people over the next century, from space travel to sustainability. You have a solar charge jacket that you say can glow like a firefly in the dark, for example. You have a \u201cblack squid\u201d jacket that you say recreates one of nature\u2019s most brilliant solutions to high visibility, the adaptive camouflage of the squid. How much tech is really involved here?Over the last five years, the angle of tech we focused on is material science. That\u2019s the one thing that, as a startup, we\u2019ve had access to, because if you\u2019re going to look at much [complex] technologies like AI or exoskeletons, you need a really huge amount of funding to go tackle those, whereas any startup can really go and look at material science. So that\u2019s the angle we\u2019re really fascinated with . ..[because]\u00a0 that\u2019s typically not been explored, how much material science could go into a product.One of the most interesting things we ever launched was the world\u2019s first graphene jacket. Even the scientists who isolated graphene for the first time can\u2019t actually tell you what graphene is going to do.\u00a0 . . .[So] we said, well, one side has graphene and the other side doesn\u2019t. Why don\u2019t you go out and test it and tell us what it does? We had a theory that it could store and redistribute heat because graphene behaves in a very surprising way and there\u2019s no limit to how much heat it can store. What came back were two particularly amazing stories, one of a U.S. doctor who\u2019d been freezing at night in the Gobi Desert and who wrapped his graphene jacket around a camel, and after it absorbed the heat of the camel, he put his jacket back on and stayed warm through the night.Another friend of ours, a Russian guy who was out in the Nepalese mountains and was in danger of freezing to death, used the graphene jacket to absorb the last rays of sun. It warmed up, and he put it on as his inner layer and credits it with keeping him warm through the night.How do you manufacture a graphene shirt or ceramic shirt? Do you have a special loom? Do you make it out of a 3D printer? What\u2019s the process?You manufacture it with great difficulty is the answer, which is why our stuff costs more than regular clothing. What you really end up with is very specialist factories, typically in Europe, with really high-tech machinery that very few people have access to.Do you typically do short production runs for your merchandise?Yes, and at the start, that was really just a function of capital, meaning we didn\u2019t have much, so we just made as many clothes as we could, they sold out really quickly, and we tried to make some more as the business has grown. There\u2019s definitely stuff where it\u2019s so complicated or so experimental, it would be reckless to make 10,000 of them. So yeah, we\u2019ve made short runs of some of our most experimental stuff, just to see: Does it work? Could it be improved?One of those experimental new products is the Mars jacket and pants. Where does one wear that?Of the funny things about making anything for Mars is that the irony, of course, that you have to test it on Earth. But the reality of going to Mars or any space travel is there\u2019s going to be an exponential increase in the number of people going there and the number of jobs they need to do when they go there. You\u2019re going to need scientists, biologists, builders, engineers, architects, they\u2019re gonna have to wear something. And so the reality is, we want to start working on it early, so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re starting to think about some of the tasks that need to be carried out, whether it\u2019s on the moon or Mars or lower orbit stuff, and about: What are the jobs? What are some of the challenges that we\u2019re going to face? This is why the jacket comes with a vomit pocket, because your vestibular system is thrown into disarray as soon as you encounter a lack of gravity.How do you know about the vestibular system? You\u2019re a marketing genius. Are you also a scientist?I\u2019m a pretend scientist [laughs]. But we have a lot of really interesting people around us, whether it\u2019s people who think about the future of warfare, or people who think about the future of space travel, we often joke that our business is run on WhatsApp.Where do you receive most of your customer feedback? Certain D2C brands are very active on social and Instagram and have Slack channels. How do things work over there?I had this really early thought that if you could combine really cool innovative technology with really friendly people on the end of email, that could be a really cool thing.You only sell directly through the Vollebak site. Will that ever change?Not in the near-term future. One of the things that\u2019s been absolutely central to the brand is getting that feedback, and I really worry about losing that connection to the customers. Let\u2019s say someone has a cool experience with one of our shirts or one of our jackets, and they bought it at some wholesale store, and they have no real connection to us. I feel that\u2019s lost information.We will be doing more stuff in the metaverse space very, very soon, because I just find it so exciting, the idea that there\u2019s going to be this competition or integration between the virtual world and real world. So we\u2019re currently building some fairly crazy stuff in that space. We\u2019re currently on the hunt for some supercomputers powerful enough to process some of the stuff we\u2019re working on. But yes, basically, anything that we think is going to define the future, we\u2019ll plow pretty heavily into.(You can hear this conversation in its entirety, including about Vollebak\u2019s plans to eventually launch a women\u2019s line and its funding situation, here.)"}
{"text": "India\u2019s Blume Ventures raises $105 million in the first close of its fourth fund. Blume Ventures said on Wednesday it has raised $105 million in the first close of its fourth fund, less than two years after finalizing its previous fund, as investment activity intensifies in the world\u2019s second-largest internet market.The 11-year-old firm, one of the largest Indian venture funds, said it expects its new fund to balloon to close to $200 million by March next year, which is when it hopes for the final close. Its current LPs include some multifamily-office wealth management funds, sovereigns and some corporates across Asia and Europe.With the new fund, the investment firm will continue to focus on backing early-stage startups in their pre-seed and pre-Series A rounds, said Karthik Reddy, co-founder and managing partner at Blume Ventures, in an interview with TechCrunch.Blume Ventures \u2014 which counts online learning platform Unacademy, fintech Slice, hyperlocal delivery service Dunzo, edtech Classplus, used-car marketplace Spinny, and insurer Turtlemint among its portfolio startups \u2014 backs early-stage startups and typically writes its starting check in the range of $1 million to $2.5 million.Over the years, Blume Ventures has become one of the most respected venture firms in the country. Even the startups that don\u2019t end up getting a check from the fund speak highly of its partners, according to many entrepreneurs with whom TechCrunch has spoken.Wednesday\u2019s announcement comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record amounts of capital. Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge Capital and SoftBank have increased the pace of their investments in India in recent quarters as they double down on finding winners in one of the last great growth markets.The pandemic has also seen many firms aggressively scramble for new strategies. But Blume Ventures appears to follow the more conservative approach. The venture firm has written about 25 checks from its previous fund and still has some reserves to do follow-on rounds, said Reddy.At the height of the pandemic, Blume Ventures was \u201cslow and thoughtful\u201d as it was not very comfortable with assessing firms over Zoom calls, he said. \u201cWe took our own time to write the last few checks,\u201d he said.\u201cWe are getting amazing love from large investors,\u201d he said, adding that it may appear that some of the startups larger firms have backed in recent quarters have seen multi-fold jumps in valuations, but he pointed to some business-to-business e-commerce marketplaces and noted that their growth build-up had been in the works for three to four years.With the firm\u2019s $102 million third fund, Blume Ventures backed a number of firms in edtech and deep-tech SaaS spaces, he said. Reddy said it was too early to say how the third fund has performed, but added that it has probably never seen its portfolio firms reach the $50 million to $100 million valuations stage faster.\u201cBut that\u2019s natural. If you have a good founder, good story to tell, you don\u2019t need a boat load of revenue to go and raise a double-digit round today,\u201d he said, adding that by March the firm expects valuation of 10 portfolio startups from the third fund to be over $75 million. \u201cThis is a first-time experience for us. It took us much longer in previous funds.\u201dWith the new fund, the largest for Blume Ventures, the firm expects to participate for longer in the lifecycle of its portfolio startups."}

Arc is not even a year old and the electric boat startup has attracted investment from top VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, entertainment industry big wigs and now a $30 million raise led by an early Tesla executive who led the automaker\u2019s early manufacturing efforts.The $30 million Series A was led by Greg Reichow, the former Tesla executive who is now a partner at Eclipse Ventures.

RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pryon, the artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by the inventors of the technologies behind today\u2019s mainstream digital assistants used by hundreds of millions of people per day, announced today new leadership and funding that will bring the next generation of interactive knowledge management to the everyday work experience.Chris Mahl joined Pryon as President and Chief Revenue Officer to oversee corporate operations and drive growth strategies. Mahl brings an extensive background in enterprise sales leadership from Oracle, Informatica and Salesforce and a track record of bringing companies to profitability in more than a decade of advising startups and venture capital firms.On the heels of an equity financing round filed in September, Pryon also welcomed new board members and observers representing some of the industry\u2019s leading venture capital funds, signaling continued confidence in the company\u2019s trajectory. The round was supported with new investments by 3ig Ventures; Duke University Management Company (DUMAC); Gaingels; Micron Ventures; Piedmont Capital Partners; Private Ventures Group; Rex Health Ventures; Samuel J. Palmisano, Chairman of the Center for Global Enterprise and former Chairman and CEO of IBM; and Steel Perlot, with existing participation from BootstrapLabs, Breyer Capital, Good Growth Capital, Greycroft and Revolution\u2019s Rise of the Rest.Incoming board members include Kirsten Wolberg, former executive with DocuSign, PayPal and Salesforce; Michelle Ritter, CEO of Steel Perlot, a management company incubating, investing in, and scaling companies in today\u2019s most challenging technical industries; and Pryon\u2019s Chris Mahl.\u201cThis is an incredible time for Pryon\u2019s platform,\u201d Ritter said. \u201cSteel Perlot believes applied AI will increasingly transform business at scale. Pryon is applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle a massive problem in workplace productivity and knowledge management. We invested in Pryon\u2019s mission and team because we believe it has the technical depth, leadership, access, and product to become a category-defining company.\u201dPalmisano said, \u201cAs businesses are accelerating their digital transformation, Pryon's AI technology addresses the critical need for organizations to translate massive volumes of legacy content into actionable knowledge.\u201dWolberg added, \u201cPryon has developed technology that fills a gap in the enterprise software stack. In my experience, what the company offers is critical for organizations who deal with large amounts of application or document-based data, or those who want to expand the capabilities of their virtual assistants. The sky is really the limit for how Pryon\u2019s platform can be applied to provide a unique level of accuracy and speed to the management of enterprise knowledge. I look forward to being a part of their journey.\u201dPryon applies AI-based intelligent document processing (IDP) to augment unstructured data from disparate sources such as application knowledge bases, digital libraries and document stores. Using proprietary computer vision and natural language engines, the company\u2019s platform enriches the content to boost accuracy. This information retrieval for question answering (IRQA) capability allows users and systems to dynamically converse with previously static information. The platform\u2019s API also rapidly expands the functionality of existing AI assistants, chatbots, and interactive voice response (IVR) installations, which can typically only respond to a limited set of requests, reducing the business impact of contact centers and help desks.Mahl said, \u201cSince the moment I met the team, I have been incredibly impressed and sense the same level of energy, quality and vision I witnessed in my time at Salesforce and other successful companies in hyper growth. Our sole purpose at Pryon is to transform enterprise content into a cohesive asset that drives business value.\u201dAbout PryonPryon is an artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on enterprise knowledge management. Its natural language processing (NLP) platform transforms unstructured data into experiences that increase productivity with unmatched accuracy and speed. Pryon\u2019s automated machine learning engines deliver rapid time to value by enriching existing content. This no-code approach prevents operational disruption and allows organizations to quickly maximize the business value trapped within their information assets. Pryon was founded by Igor Jablokov, whose previous company defined the state of the art for AI assistants and was acquired by Amazon to form the basis for Alexa.
