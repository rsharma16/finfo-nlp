{"text": "Hacking people is too easy: CultureAI announces $4m seed round to measure and mitigate human cyber security risk. MANCHESTER, England, Nov. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0CultureAI, the human cyber security platform founded by professional hackers, today announced the closing of a $4 million Seed round to fuel its rapid growth. The investment was led by Senovo and saw participation from new investors Conviction alongside existing investors Passion Capital. Angel investors Paul Forster (Co-founder, Indeed) and Guntram Friede (Head of Marketing, EMEA Salesforce & MuleSoft) also joined the round to support CultureAI's disruption of the cyber security awareness market. The additional capital accelerates product development and enables CultureAI to expand into new markets.Founded when professional hacker James Moore saw even the best security awareness training made no difference to attackers' ability to compromise organisations, CultureAI is being adopted by a rapidly growing number of organisations to easily identify and prevent security incidents caused by employees. \"It's almost unheard of for professional hackers (known as penetration testers) to fail to gain access to an organisation, even if they have great security awareness training for employees,\" explains James, who continues \"We successfully gain access to organisations' data and systems every time and it's almost always as a result of human behaviour or error. As an example, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is often touted as a key cyber defence \u2013 yet we find that an average of 32% of employees accept MFA authentication requests sent by attackers, essentially opening the door for them. The traditional awareness training approach simply doesn't improve behaviours like this \u2013 hacking people is still too easy.\"James believes security coaching, not training, is key \u2013 \"Outside of security, when someone starts to learn a sport or a new skill and wants to improve, they get a coach. A coach observes behaviour, corrects mistakes in real-time, and gives them tailored advice whilst motivating and empowering them by providing the right equipment to perform. A coach doesn't simply tell them to watch some generic training videos, take a multiple choice quiz and then expect them to be perfect; which is, regrettably, the common approach to security awareness today. We built CultureAI to detect human security risks and automatically use those insights to drive technical interventions and coaching - not simply 'train' people. It's a very different way to managing human risk.\"\"CultureAI is revolutionising human security with a data-driven approach, disrupting the $1 billion security awareness industry,\" says Jon Stokes, chief technology officer. \"Within minutes our platform is detecting human security incidents across the organisation and combining those events with machine-learning to automatically drive cyber security coaching programmes that are intelligently tailored to each employees' cyber strengths, weaknesses and job role. As human risk events are detected, the platform creates employee security scores to allow organisations to understand their entire human risk surface for the first time. Human security event data is also pushed to clients' existing security tools in real-time, enabling automated mitigation of human security incidents.

{"text": "Help Therapeutics Completes Series C Financing of 25 Million Dollars. NANJING, China, Nov. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Recently, the iPSC therapeutics leading global platform company - Help Therapeutics announced the completion of Series C financing of 25 millions of\u00a0dollars. This round of financing was led by Ming Bioventures, followed by Share Capital, Beisen Medical Fund, and Jolmo Capital, with additional support from our old shareholder Purple Bull Startups, and Hoyue Capital acting as the exclusive financial advisor for this round of financing. The financing will help the company conduct and complete clinical trials of its fully independent intellectual property development pipeline, iPSC heart cell injection, and will initiate clinical studies of immune cell therapy based on iPSC technology within the next year.Help TherapeuticsAs the first company in China to develop and manufacture cell therapy using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, Help Therapeutics insists on focusing on the fields of heart failure and tumor immune diseases to develop general-purpose cell therapy products to meet clinical demand.The company's founder, Dr. Wang Jiaxian, is a medical doctor from the University of Hong Kong and a postdoctoral fellow at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the United States. During his time as a cardiologist, Dr. Wang became concerned that the population of heart failure patients in China has reached over 10 million, and there are about 3 million patients with severe heart failure waiting for heart transplants every year, but only about 600 people can find heart donor, a huge gap that has become a problem for the entire medical community. Dr. Wang chose to enter the field of iPSC cell therapy in 2010, convinced that iPSC technology is a groundbreaking technology for human medicine, and looking forward to saving heart failure patients through this innovative cutting-edge technology. After years of development, the company has developed several product pipelines based on iPSC technology, mastering advanced iPSC reprogramming technology while having the capability of large-scale automated production and cell quality inspection of iPSC drugs.iPSC pipeline layout \u00a0Break through the heart failure treatment dilemmaHelp Therapeutics has laid out several R&D pipelines in the areas of heart failure and tumor immunity, among which iPSC technology therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe heart failure has entered several authoritative centers nationwide to conduct large-scale randomized controlled human clinical trials. Help Therapeutics has accumulated profound experience in the field of heart failure cell therapy: In 2020, Nature reported the world's first human study of iPSC cells for end-stage heart failure conducted jointly by the company and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Based on 24-month follow-up data from three patients in this clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of Help Therapeutics's iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte drug for the treatment of severe heart failure were excellent.The company has already obtained the first iPSC technology-based heart failure cell therapy clinical study filing from the National Health Care Commission in China, and is also actively preparing clinical registration filings for both the U.S. and China for its heart failure treatment pipeline. After clinical trials, this product is expected to be the first iPSC cell therapy drug for moderate to severe heart failure in China and the world, and its social and commercial value will be incalculable.Artificial intelligence fully automated production line, the world's first biopharmaceutical 4.0 eraWith the development of the cell therapy industry, the quantity and quality of cell culture are in more refined and higher demand, both from the perspective of clinical demand and R&D exploration. The current manual culture of cell therapy products has long operation time, large variation between product batches, low batch culture capacity and other industry bottlenecks, and thus the cost and terminal selling price of cellular drugs remain high, and cannot really reach the majority of patients. Therefore, addressing the commercial mass production of cells has become central to the development of cell therapy companies.Help Therapeutics\u00a0is at the forefront of the world's technology in terms of cell mass production and quality assurance. Its fully automated production line has reached the international leading position, improving the quality and stability of cellular products while significantly reducing production costs. The annual production capacity of a single production line can meet 100,000 doses, contributing to the popularization of cellular products. The company's fully automated production pipeline was selected for the National \"13th Five-Year Plan\" Science and Technology Innovation Achievement Exhibition.Taking the responsibility of the country as our ownHelp Therapeutics\u00a0has the first induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) biospecimen bank authorized by the Ministry of Science and Technology for the preservation of human genetic resources in China. Entrusted by the National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform and as the only officially recognized iPSC rare disease cell bank in the National 14th Five-Year Plan (National Science and Technology Heritage Office [2021]-BC0022), Help Therapeutics carries the heavy responsibility of human genetic material and makes every effort to promote the role of China's iPSC technology platform and rare disease research and development treatment.\u00a0Help Therapeutics\u00a0will provide high-quality and diversified biological samples to research institutions and enterprises, accelerate rare disease research and orphan drug development, and help the rapid development of iPSC cell industry.SOURCE Help Therapeutics", "metadata": "2021-11-28"}

{"text": "Foundry Lab raises $8M to quickly, cheaply create metal castings using a microwave. Remember Easy Bake Ovens? You\u2019d mix up some colored powder and water until a dough or batter formed, put it in a mold, pop it in the oven, and before you knew it \u2014 ding! A disgusting treat. Foundry Lab, a New-Zealand based startup with backing from Rocket Lab\u2019s Peter Beck, has figured out how to do something similar, except instead of chemicals and an \u201coven,\u201d it\u2019s metals and a microwave.The company, which emerged from stealth on Monday with an $8 million Series A raise, is using \u201cliterally a microwave, but on steroids\u201d to cast metal parts much quicker than metal 3D printing, according to David Moodie, founder and CEO of Foundry.\u201cIt\u2019s super easy for the user; they literally take the mold, throw in the cold metal powder or metal ingots, put it in the microwave, press the button and walk away,\u201d Moodie told TechCrunch. \u201cIt even dings when it\u2019s done. As easy as heating up a microwave dinner.\u201d(Foundry\u2019s microwave has also been used to cook a typical New Zealand meat pie. It took only a few seconds and didn\u2019t taste fantastic, according to Moodie.)Typical casting systems like investment casting, 3D printing and die-casting take anywhere from one to six weeks to produce. Foundry says it has been able to turn around brake shoes for cars in under eight hours using molds that had been 3D printed using computer-aided design (CAD) molds and a giant microwave. The startup is currently working with zinc and aluminum, but has done some successful stainless steel trials and wants to move onto other metals like copper and brass in the future.While Foundry\u2019s tech has future applications in manufacturing industries where metal 3D printing can\u2019t reach, the near-term goal is to help car manufacturing R&D teams develop production-identical, functional metal parts that can be used for testing and prototyping before committing to mass production.\u201cOne of the companies we\u2019re talking to is making up to 600 prototype cars before one reaches the market, so they\u2019ll keep changing and keep iterating on it, and that can get expensive really quickly,\u201d Moodie said, adding that tooling costs could be upwards of $50,000 to $100,000.Moodie says before starting Foundry, he ran an industrial design consultancy business, designing products for mass manufacture. He felt frustrated that authorities would consistently reject patent applications because they were made with parts produced by 3D printers or CNC machines, and therefore, potentially made with the wrong physical structures.\u201cSo I did the Kiwi thing and went to the shed and lucked my way into a system that worked,\u201d he said, noting that much of his experimenting was done using standard microwaves during New Zealand\u2019s latest lockdown, during which time Moodie couldn\u2019t get into his workshop. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to solve is actual castings, trying to simulate a die casting but doing it fast and cheaply. If you machine to a tool to do a die casting, it\u2019s typically three to six months to get that back.\u201dIt\u2019s still early days for Foundry. The company only has a couple of its very large microwaves out for trial with potential customers at the moment, but it will use the Series A funding, which came from Australian VC Blackbird, to get production-ready by the end of 2023.Part of the funding will go toward hiring more staff. The company has grown quickly over the past few months, up from six staffers when it first started fundraising to 17 full-time employees now. The goal is to make it to around 35 over the coming months, a task that\u2019s been difficult with New Zealand\u2019s strict pandemic-related border closures.\u201cThe whole border close thing is starting to hit us now,\u201d said Moodie. \u201cThe country\u2019s got two microwave experts, and they both have jobs. That\u2019s been particularly difficult. So we\u2019re trying to get someone to come across and help us.\u201dNew Zealand is beginning to open up internally, with Auckland coming out of lockdown this week and the city borders opening up to the rest of the country in mid-December. Unless the new omicron variant holds things up, the country is expected to start inviting vaccinated travelers back starting April 30, 2022, giving Foundry and other New Zealand startups the chance to hire talent from abroad.Even though Foundry is working out of New Zealand, it\u2019s targeting markets in the United States and Europe.\u00a0The company\u2019s long game is to continue to work on the microwaves and get them to a point where they can produce the quantities needed for mass production.", "metadata": "2021-11-28"}
{"text": "Upbound nabs $60M to grow its open source Crossplane multi-cloud management project. Companies today want to avoid the lock-in they faced in the past with a single vendor. As a result, they are hedging their bets with a multi-cloud strategy, but this creates a new problem around finding a single tool for managing it all. That\u2019s where Upbound comes in with its open source Crossplane\u00a0multi-cloud management tool.It\u2019s a big problem, and up until now, companies have relied on the cloud vendors themselves to manage each one separately. While some solutions like Google Anthos and Red Hat OpenShift have come along, there was a lack of open source tooling until Upbound released Crossplane in May 2020.Investors recognized the need identified by Upbound and rewarded the company with a $60 million Series B to help build the open source project while looking to grow the commercial version of the product. Altimeter Capital led the round with participation from GV, Intel Capital and Telstra Ventures.Upbound founder and CEO Bassam Tabbara said that while the market has attempted to find a solution to this management challenge, he believes that his company is the first to build an open source community with the hope of developing this single management console and single API to manage across cloud tools.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of efforts around trying to build a single point of control. None of them have attacked this problem from a community perspective, creating a universal control plane that enables that in [a] community, while [building] the convergence around it,\u201d he said.\u201cI think of Crossplane as the first to get to a point where we actually now have a convergence effect around a single universal cloud API. This has never happened before. It\u2019s truly the first time that we\u2019ve gotten to one. You can go to Crossplane right now and you get one declarative API that can be used to address all cloud resources and infrastructure sources across all vendors.\u201dTabbara points out that the project is fully cloud-native and is managed under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which manages Kubernetes and other key open source cloud-native technologies.He said that Crossplane allows users to pick and choose the cloud vendors they want to use \u2014 whether cloud infrastructure vendors like AWS, Microsoft and Google or cloud-native tooling like Elastic, Confluent, Databricks and Snowflake \u2014 and manage all of that from a single API.The company has grown and helped nurture the open source project and developed a commercial product in parallel called Upbound (like the company), which customers can install themselves in their cloud of choice or use a SaaS version that Upbound will manage for them.It\u2019s not only catching on with users. Tabbara said he has also been seeing major vendors like AWS, Azure, Equinix and IBM building integrations for Crossplane. He believes this is key, and it\u2019s similar to the dynamic we saw in 2017 when the major cloud players began to rally around Kubernetes and the CNCF.\u201cIt\u2019s truly to the point where there is now a real convergence effect around Crossplane, not unlike the convergence effect that we saw around Kubernetes as a project, and not unlike the convergence we saw around Linux as a project,\u201d he said.It seems to be a project and a commercial vision with tremendous potential, one that investors see as a pivotal piece of the cloud puzzle and are willing to pour in significant capital to help build. If Upbound can execute on this vision, it may be onto something truly transformative, but only time will tell if they can make that happen.What open source-based startups can learn from Confluent\u2019s success story", "metadata": "2021-11-28"}

Steve DentContributor\t\tSteve Dent is an associate editor at Engadget.\tMore posts by this contributorTesla requires Full Self Driving testers to allow video collection in case of a crashUK will require new homes to have EV chargers starting in 2022Nissan will invest 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) over the next five years developing new EVs and battery technology as part of a grand plan it calls \u201cAmbition 2030,\u201d the company announced. It aims to release 15 new EVs total by 2030, with electrified vehicles making up half its vehicle lineup at that point.The automaker said it will develop 23 electrified vehicles in total over the next eight years, with 20 of those coming in the next five years alone. It\u2019s shooting for a market mix of 75 percent electrified (EV and e-Power PHEV/hybrids) in Europe, 55 percent in Japan and 40 percent in the US and China by 2030.The other part of that mix, would presumably be internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It\u2019s worth noting that in early 2021, Nissan said that it planned to electrify every all-new car it launches by the early 2030s. Presumably, then, any ICE vehicles still available would be legacy models.Nissan will launch EVs with all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by 2028 and ready a pilot plant in Yokohama as early as 2024, it said. That technology promises benefits like reduced charging times, but has yet to arrive to market as expected. The company also wants to bring the cost of battery packs down to $75 per kWh by 2028 with a reduction to $65 kWh further down the road. That would be about half of what EV batteries cost last year, according to Bloomberg. By 2030, Nissan hopes to be producing 130 GWh of batteries.The company said it plans to expand its ProPilot driver assistance technology to over 2.5 million Nissan and Infiniti vehicles by 2026. It will also incorporate next-generation LIDAR systems \u201con virtually every new model by fiscal year 2030.\u201dNissanAs part of Ambition 2030, Nissan also unveiled no less than four concept cars: the Chill-Out, Surf-Out, Hang-Out and Max-Out. Like most concepts, they\u2019re meant to give a taste of Nissan\u2019s future technology including self-driving, interior features and just far-out designs. However, Nissan has only shown images of the Chill-Out as a real vehicle, with renders of the other three vehicles.The Chill-Out (top and above) is a smallish crossover that could be an early preview of the next-generation Leaf, which Nissan previously confirmed would move from a hatch to a crossover style body. It will use the Ariya\u2019s CMF-EV platform and e-4orce electric all-wheel drive system, and could arrive by 2025.NissanThe Surf-Out, meanwhile, is a small electric single cab pickup with a decent-sized bed and removable canopy. It would come with a dual-motor AWD setup and a variety of power outputs, offering off-road performance, utility power and extended cargo space.NissanThen there\u2019s the Hang-Out, which is more like a small camper van/SUV designed to \u201cprovide a new way of spending time on the move.\u201d It has a completely flat floor and movable, theater-like seats, offering \u201cthe comfort of your living room in a mobile space\u201d \u2014 something we\u2019ve seen with other recent EV concepts. It also offers e-4orce and advanced ProPilot features.NissanFinally, the Max-Out is a concept convertible sports car that offers \u201csuperlative stability and comfort.\u201d Body roll is limited to deliver \u201cdynamic cornering and steering response\u201d to optimize handling and occupant comfort. It\u2019s supposedly lightweight with a very low center of gravity, and also offers advanced e-4orce.Nissan\u2019s new plan comes as the company has grappled with internal problems, including the arrest and subsequent flight of former CEO Carlos Ghosn.

FJDynamics, founded by DJI\u2019s former chief scientist Wu Di, just closed a Series B round of $70 million as it advances its goal to empower workers in the harshest environment with robotic technologies.When I asked Wu what\u2019s special about his company\u2019s farming robots, he gave an answer that would make any publicist sweat: \u201cI don\u2019t think our technology is that special.\u201d The startup\u2019s vision, he said, is to make useful and affordable robots for the most labor-intensive industries.\u201cYou can have the most advanced AI algorithms,\u201d he continued, \u201cBut if the technology doesn\u2019t work on the production line or the farm, because you don\u2019t have any industry experience, then how does your technology benefit people?\u201dThe technologies that Wu worked on before FJDynamics were cutting-edge in every sense. At DJI, he served as the chief scientist and oversaw the drone giant\u2019s acquisition of the Swedish format camera maker Victor Hasselblad AB in 2017. Before returning to China, he spent a decade in Sweden, during which he earned a PhD in domain-specific processor design. He also worked as a vice president at fabless semiconductor company Coresonic AB and a director at the Swedish luxury sports car maker Koenigsegg AB.\u201cAfter seeing all these first-class technologies, it\u2019s a stretch to say we [FJDynamics] are a high-tech company,\u201d said the founder, who donned a slightly faded checkered shirt and a pair of thin-rimmed glasses on the morning of our interview.We were sitting in a makeshift meeting room, a partition comprising a few desks separated from the rest of the open-plan office by movable walls. The company, located in Shenzhen\u2019s bustling tech hub Shenzhen, was fast expanding and approaching 1,000 employees.Wu Di, founder and CEO of FJDynamicsIn 2019, Wu left DJI to start FJDynamics. The company set out with a focus on agricultural robots, building tools like unmanned lawnmowers, orchard sprayers and feed pushing machines. It has since ventured into other fields that depend heavily on manual work, such as construction and manufacturing.As Beijing invokes a digital upgrade in the country\u2019s traditional industries, Chinese companies like FJDynamics are in hot demand by investors. FJDynamics itself has attracted a rank of heavyweight financiers, including Tencent and state-owned automaker Dongfeng Asset Management. DJI had a stake in the company early on but has since sold off its shares.It declined to name its sole investor in its latest Series B round and only said it is a major internet firm in China. The funding, the company said, will allow it to \u201cgrow its suite of robotics automation technology across agriculture, facility management, construction and gardening, along with supporting the increasing demand of the company\u2019s ESG product offerings in over 60 countries.\u201dOver the years, a raft of tech talent has left DJI to set up their own shops or join others\u2019 fledgling projects. Portable battery maker EcoFlow, hairdryer Zuvi, electric toothbrush brand Evowera are among the most high-profile ones. For Wu, what drove him away from a prestigious position at the world\u2019s largest drone company was a sense of disconnection he felt making \u201cluxury\u201d hardware.\u201cIf you look at how robotic technology is being applied, there are a lot of companies using drones and autonomous vehicles. But the majority of people on earth aren\u2019t benefiting from it.\u201d\u201cAgriculture, construction, gardening\u2026 Work conditions in these sectors are physically demanding and there are still a lot of us doing this kind of job. The question is how we use robotic technology to improve their work environment, and that doesn\u2019t mean simply replacing them with robots,\u201d said the founder.Image Credits: FJDynamics\u2019 cow feed pusher, printed with the logo of Sveaverken, a Swedish farming company it acquiredOne of FJDynamics\u2019 popular products is the automated feed pusher. To produce high-quality milk, cows need to be fed about ten times throughout the day. The routine requires farms to have staff on-site 24 hours. A farm with 500 cows, for example, needs about three grass feeders to take shifts. But in poorer countries, farms can\u2019t afford to have as many workers and staff could be out tending to the cows all day even in the coldest season.FJDynamics aims to make farmers\u2019 work easier. Its vision-guided feeder, which costs about 20,000 euros each, can feed up to 500 cows a day. In 2019, it acquired the 110-year-old Swedish farming company Sveaverken, which has helped put the Chinese firm\u2019s feed pushing robots to work.\u201cI never talk about technology to my customers. The farmer is more interested in whether my product can help improve the crop yield,\u201d said Wu. \u201cEvery farmer is an economist.\u201dBecause of the company\u2019s vision in \u201cmaking tech affordable\u201d, margins are \u201cmodest\u201d and the management is vigilant about operational costs.At the moment, about 40% of the startup\u2019s sales happen outside China across some 60 countries. Many Chinese companies expanding overseas are increasingly cagey about their origin, fearing hostility against anything labeled \u201cChinese\u201d. Wu takes a more proactive approach.\u201cEven though I\u2019ve lived in Europe for ten years, I can\u2019t rip off my skin. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s important \u2014 whether it\u2019s a Chinese, American or Swedish entrepreneur\u2026 As long as I build great products and bring benefits to my customers, there will be users.\u201dData compliance is especially key to a company\u2019s global expansion. FJDynamics provides the hardware and software while its local partners help deploy the \u201csystem\u201d using the data. Microsoft Azure is its main cloud partner outside China to allow \u201celastic deployment while meeting data privacy requirements such as GDPR.\u201d\u201cOur culture is that we don\u2019t want the data,\u201d Wu said.Unlike smartphones or drones that require sophisticated processors, FJDynamics\u2019 products use relatively simple chips that could be found in China, so the firm is likely immune from the recent supply chain disruptions, the founder reckoned.While Wu may not be working on the most advanced technology anymore, he looks for ways to impart his knowledge. When he\u2019s not developing the next farming robot, he lectures at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen.\u201cI live a simple life that focuses on two things \u2014 product [FJDynamics] and education,\u201d the founder said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot and realized that money can\u2019t change you or make you happier. So you need a simple goal, and achieving the simple goal makes your life happier.\u201d", "metadata": "2021-11-28"}

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Upbound, the cloud management platform company behind the popular open source Crossplane project, today announced that it raised $60M in new funding. The new funding includes a Series B round led by Altimeter Capital with participation from GV, Intel Capital, and Telstra Ventures. The funding follows 10x quarter-over-quarter recurring revenue growth fueled by Crossplane adoption and enterprise demand for Upbound\u2019s product offering. Upbound will use the funding to broaden its worldwide go-to-market efforts, accelerate product development, and expand its services and support offerings. To-date, Upbound has raised $69 million.\u201cWe believe that Upbound is distinctly positioned to be the convergence point for cloud infrastructure,\u201d said Ram Woo, partner at Altimeter Capital. \u201cThe Crossplane project they invented builds on the momentum of the cloud-native community, and the company's remarkable growth is a testament to the Kubernetes-first approach desired by platform engineers. We have been watching Upbound for a while and are excited to partner with Bassam and team.\u201dWith the rise of Kubernetes and the cloud-native movement, enterprise infrastructure is undergoing a wave of modernization not seen since the dawn of cloud computing. Legacy Infrastructure-as-Code tooling is no longer adequate to manage multiple cloud vendor environments, deploy applications into different clouds, and accelerate the application development cycle. Upbound created Crossplane in 2018 to offer the cloud-native community a Universal Control Plane for this new era of cloud computing. For the first time, the industry has rallied around a consistent, declarative, and vendor-neutral API for the cloud.Upbound\u2019s Universal Cloud Platform makes it easy for enterprises to transform their internal operations into a comprehensive cloud platform, simplifying infrastructure management and empowering developers with self-service capabilities. In an era where cloud computing is heading towards more horizontal integration, enterprises can truly achieve a single point of control for all their teams, applications, workloads and vendors. Infrastructure managed via Upbound adheres to an organization's policy guardrails and is continuously reconciled, simplifying Day 2 operations, eliminating configuration drift entirely, and enabling a much higher degree of automation than was previously possible.\u201cWe\u2019re going all-in on the Universal Control Plane approach Upbound is bringing to market,\u201d said Sidarta Oliveira, Director of Infrastructure & Cloud at Grupo Botic\u00e1rio. \u201cThanks to Upbound, we\u2019re rapidly transforming our approach to infrastructure management and application development and are able to bring the same cloud native practices and tooling to both our operator and developer teams.\u201dFounded by open source industry veteran and Rook co-creator Bassam Tabbara in 2017, Upbound is quickly being recognized by leading enterprises around the world that have adopted Kubernetes.

Crossplane and Upbound work out of the box with thousands of tools and products in the cloud native ecosystem.

Today\u2019s funding announcement ensures we continue to help them on their journey with innovative products and services.\u201dThe company recently announced a fully self-hosted, self-managed version of its Universal Cloud Platform with strict security requirements in response to customer demand. Upbound also continues to invest in the open source Crossplane community.

{"text": "Immusoft Receives $4M in Funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Immusoft of CA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Immusoft Corporation, a cell therapy company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare diseases, announced today that the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has awarded the company a $4M grant to support the development of its ISP-002 (for delivery of iduronate sulfatase) program in mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), an inherited disease for which patients have limited options.MPS II is a rare genetic disease in children, which causes abnormalities across many organs, including the heart and lungs, and the musculoskeletal system. If untreated, individuals with severe MPS II will not live past their teen years. Currently available treatments for MPS II do not sufficiently provide therapeutic agents at stable levels, resulting in considerable residual burden of disease.Immusoft\u2019s therapeutic is specially tailored to combine a cell therapy with a gene-encoded medicine. In the case of ISP-002, the patient\u2019s own B cells are programmed to express the therapeutic enzyme iduronate sulfatase (IDS). In healthy individuals, IDS contributes to the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are harmful at high levels. Once clinical testing is initiated for ISP-002, the cells will be delivered back to the patient where they are expected to release IDS at therapeutic levels, around the clock \u2013 potentially for years.\u201cISP-002 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in children who suffer from mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). Preclinical data suggests ISP-002 can meaningfully reduce accumulated glycosaminoglycans in various tissues, and our approach also holds the potential to provide patients with durable delivery of the therapeutic continuously,\u201d said Sean Ainsworth, Chief Executive Officer, Immusoft. \u201cWe are honored that CIRM has recognized the potential value of ISP-002 and we look forward to advancing our candidate into clinical trials in this rare genetic disease where patients have limited options.\u201d\u201cOur goal is to always move the most promising research forward as fast as we can,\u201d said Dr. Maria Millan, President and Chief Executive Officer, California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). \u201cThat\u2019s why these programs are so important. They reflect potential therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in the lab and are ready to take the next step, to undergo further testing and examination to see if they might be able to work in patients.\u201dImmusoft is developing a new modality of gene delivery that holds the promise of being both durable and re-dosable. There is significant potential across multiple high-value disease states to replace suboptimal standard of care, beginning with Hurler Syndrome (MPS I). Immusoft\u2019s lead candidate ISP-001 is expected to enter Phase I clinical trials for MPS I in 2022. The current standard of care for MPS I is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and there is a significant unmet need for new therapies with improved efficacy and convenience.About ImmusoftImmusoft of CA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Immusoft Corporation.
